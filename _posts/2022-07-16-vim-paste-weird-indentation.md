# Vim pasting without the weird indentation

### ðŸ“Œ Issue
I wanted to paste the code from clipboard using vim, but when the code got longer, the formatting became super weird with a lot of tabs.

### ðŸ“Œ Solution
It was actually really simple.

Before typing `i` to enter the insert mode, type `:set paste`.

If you go to insert mode after doing so, you'll be seeing `--INSERT (paste)--`. In this mode, pasing works the way you want it to!
