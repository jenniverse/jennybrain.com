# What counts as a language?
Speakers of ‘languages’ may have *linguistic* rights to use their language. Speakers of ‘dialects’ almost never have similar rights.

<br>

# Two linguistic theories of the definition of "language"
## 📚 The Invariant System Hypothesis
Assume that a language should be taken to be the combination of a set of vocabulary and grammatical rules shared and used in the same way by a particular community

* Problem: no two individuals make use of an identical set of rules and vocab when they speak.
* We all have different, idiosyncratic ways of speaking -> **idiolect**


## 📢 The Mutual Intelligibility Hypothesis (MIH)
Speakers don't need to share identical rule systems and vocabularies to be viewed as speakers of a single language, but they must be speakers of varieties which are mutually intelligible.

* Problem: Counter-examples
  * Type 1: 2+ varieties of speech are mutually intelligible, but are classified as different languages
  - Hindi and Urdu
  * Type 2: 2+ varieties are mutually unintelligible, but are classified as varieties (dialects) of the same language.
  - Chinese: Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Shanghainese…

*Socio-political factors matter*
### "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy. -Max Weinreich"

# Dialects
### 📍 Property 1:
A dialect is a variety that is NOT recognized as a distinct language, but is related to some officially-recognized language – dialects are both similar to and different from some languages. 
### 📍 Property 2:
Differences between dialects and standard forms of language occur in:
- Accent - pronunciation
- Vocabulary
- Grammar
### 📍 Property 3:
Dialects are commonly associated with a single geographical area/region.
### 📍 Property 4:
Linguists assume that the dialects of a language are all mutually intelligible, to a large degree.

- **Isoglosses**: Boundary lines marking the distribution of dialect variables
- **Dialect continuum**: Dialects blend into each other, and it's hard to identify where one ends and another begins.

## Three kinds of non-regional dialects
- Religious dialects
- Social dialects
- Ethnic dialects

<br>
<br>

## 📣 Styles and Registers
- All speakers use their language in different ways -formal and informal **styles** of speaking.
- **Register**: a type of speech used in a specific activity/job

## 🎨 Factors influencing shifts in style
- The participants
- The setting
- The topic
- Relationship between participants
  - Solidarity
  - Power

*A range of factors trigger different ways of speaking.*

<br>
<br>

## Languages with special roles
### 🗃 Official Languages
OLs are established for *pragmatic* reasons.
Official languages are specified for:
- Area of life/activity
- Geographical area - either all of a country or a sub-part
<!--done-->
### 🌏 National Languages
NLs are *symbolic* and intended to represent the nation and its projected national identity.

<br>
<br>

## Language Planning
When developing a national or official language, **language planning** must be carried out.
### 📍 [Step 1] Status Planning
Giving special roles to certain language/varieties (selecting new NLs and OLs).
### 📍 [Step 2] Corpus Planning
Further developing the languages selcected in Step 1.
- Develop vocab
- Create dictionaries
- Decided pronunciation
- Decide how the language should be written (**graphization**)
<!--done-->
### 📍 [Step 3] Promotion of new NLs/OLs
- Mass education
- Mass media
- Positive incentives
<!--done-->
### 📍 [Step 4] Winning acceptance
- Encourage people to use and be proud of the new NL/OL.
- Emphasize the practical value
<!--done-->
<br>

### 🛠 NLs should fulfill four special functions:
1. Unifying
2. Separatist (distinguish its speakers from those of other nations)
3. Prestige
4. Frame-of-reference (be well-standardized)
<!--done-->
<br>

## Language purification and Linguistic protectionism
### 🧼 Language purification
- Borrowed words (loanwords) are replaced with new native/internally-sourced words.
<!--done-->
### 🥽 Linguistic protectionism
- Policy that new words should only be created from internal resources
- Old borrowed words are not eliminated (<-> language purification)
<!--done-->

<br>

# Languages under pressure: minority groups and language loss
## What causes people not to use or learn their Heritage Languages?
1. Political factors
2. Social pressures
3. Economic factors
4. Social status
5. Inter-marriage
6. The influence of school
7. Children's lack of motivation to learn/use the HL.
<!--done-->
## Capacity-Opportunity-Desire / COD
A framework for assessing prospects for HL maintenance to be successful.
- **Capacity**: abilities that individuals develop in the HL
- **Opportunity**: the chances that speakers have to use the HL outside the home in daily life
- **Desire**: the eagerness that individuals have to use the HL
<!--done-->
<br>

## 📉 Language endangerment and language death
Languages all over the world are becoming *moribund*.
- If a language is not being transmitted well to younger generations, it is "moribund".
### Large languages and small languages
- There are 8 languages with 100+ million L1 speakers.
  - English, Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Hindi, Bengali
  - **96% of the world's languages are spoken by only 4% of the world's population.**
  - If a language with 20,000 speakers or less should be characterized as *endangered*, then:
    - 2/3 of the world's languages are currently endangered, and may completely disappear during the course of the 21stC.
<!--done-->
### 👿 Causes of language endangerment
1. Economic factors
2. Social factors
3. The growth of larger languages
4. Globalization
5. Urbanization
6. Invasion and colonization
7. Physical causes


## Positive reactions to language endangerment
### 📑 Language documentation
- The goal is establishing good descriptions and records of endangered languages before they disapper.
### ☀️ Language revitalization
- Bilingual education
- Pre-school *"language nests"*
  
<br>

### *Speakers of endangered languages don't need to abanbon their heritage languages to acquire another major language.*

<br>
<br>

# Diglossia and Code-switching
## Diglossia
- **Diglossia**: Swiching between two different varieties of the same language in *different areas of life*.
1. Two distinct varities of the same language are used by speakers in a population
2. **H**igh and **L**ow varieties each have different functions - used in different areas of life.
3. H and L are learned at different times and in different environments.
4. The H variety is never used in informal conversation.
5. The H variety my often be standardized.
6. Literature/writing is predominantly in H.
### 🎤 Domains of H/L use
- Religious activities are carried out in H (not L).
- Newspapers and technical/academic writing are regularly in H.
- TV soap operas are in L.
### 🪢 Extended diglossia
- Two distinct languages patterning in the typical H and L ways.

<br>

## Code-switching
- **Code-switching**: Switching between two (or more) different languages in *a single conversation*.
### 🎛 Levels of code-switching
1. Sentence-boundary CS
2. Extra-sentential CS (*tag-insertion*)
3. Clause-boundary CS
4. Intra-sentential CS (*code-mixing*)
- **Insertional CS**: words from L2 are inserted into the L1 base.
- **Alternational CS**: both L1 and L2 appear in equal amounts.
### 💡 What causes people to CS?
1. Imbalanced in the knowledge of L1 and L2.
2. Stylistic reasons
   - "For fun"
   - To emphasize what they are saying
3. Identity-related reasons
   - Convergence
     - To stress solidarity/closeness with others
     - **Downwards shifting**: to stress solidarity
   - Divergence
     - To signal unfriendliness and social distance
     - "Linguistic dueling"
     - **Upward shifting**: to show education
   - Unmarked language: The language that is conventionally used in a siuation X.
   - Marked languageL: The language that is not usually used in a situation X.
