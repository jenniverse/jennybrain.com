# Markup and share photos without saving them

## ðŸ’¡ Why I made this
It's easy to just draw something on the photo that others shared on some apps. However, when you're using `Messages`, you can't do this without actually saving the photo.

I didn't want to save random screenshots just to highlight a single line and send it back.

<br>

Using the `Shortcuts`, this can be easily done!

<br>

This is the shortcut:
