# iPhone Notes shortcut for diary

## ‚è∞ This is a super simple iPhone shorcut that takes ‚â§ 5 min to make.

<br>

## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A little piece of background info about myself

I used to write a diary on notebook every night. It has been around 10 years since I started writing it everyday. However, recently I've been skipping it for several reasons. But since so many things are happening lately, I thought I should start writing it again.

I've been writing diary every night on [Notes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205773) starting last week. (Yes, the Notes app that's already installed on your apple devices.) I'm using iCloud, so I can write, view, or edit my diary on any apple device.

I had some unexpected free time, and I got bored. While taking shower, I randomly thought of making a shortcut for it, so I did.

<br>

## üí° Idea

I write my diary in this format:
![My diary format](pics/220530/example_diary.png)
- The title is a date in MMM dd format.
- The first sentence is the title ‚Äî maybe more like a subtitle.
- The rest of it is the body.
  
<br>

When these are viewed in a list, it would look like this:
![My diary list](pics/220530/example_list.png)
The grey boxes are the subtitles of notes.

So everytime you write a diary, the subtitle and the body text would change, but the format of title (Date) would not.

<br>

‚úîÔ∏è I wanted my shortcut to do this:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è when running the shortcut,
```
if there is already a note with today's date as a title
    open the note
else
    create a note with today's date as a title in a diary folder
    open the note
```
Simple, right?

<br>

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Result

Unfortunately, it seemed like there was no nice way to create a new folder in shortcut. To keep things simple, I just set the default folder as `Today`. Therefore, to use this shortcut, you would need to either change the default folder in shortcut manually or create a `Today` folder.

This is the shortcut link:
