# Thoughts after my first internship interview with Apple

> THIS IS MY FIRST INTERNSHIP INTERVIEW...BUT WITH APPLE???

## ‚è≥ Amount of time it took 
- 30 minutes via Webex and 30 minutes of phone call

<br>

## üì® I got an email from a recruiter
The title was...
> "Internship opportunity with Apple's PPO Team!"

How could you not get excited with that title?!

<br>

After I email them back with answers to their questions
I got a conformation email with the interview schedule.

<br>

## üìö How I prepared
This was the first time doing interview with company recruiter, so I didn't really know what I should be preparing. I reviewed my resume, I studied a little bit of the topic that I thought they might ask about, and tried to come up with answers to generic interview questions.

<br>

## üéô How it went
Recruiters were less scary than I thought...üòÄ (Maybe I was expecting something too extreme.)
They asked me things about my project that I wrote on my resume, and they asked me some technical questions related to the job they do.

- What's the difference between HDR and SDR?
- If you want to un-filter the image, how would you do it?
  - How would you do it using MATLAB?
- How would you reverse-engineer the Instagram filter?
- If you have SDR image but you want it to be look like HDR image, how would you do it?
  - What meta data would you need?

I didn't really know much about that topic, so I had to make anything up quickly and try to answer as much as I could. 

<br>

## ‚úîÔ∏è Overall

I was so grateful that I got to have an opportunity to have interview with Apple. I'm not quite sure how it went, since I was busy answering the questions. I wasn't freaking out, and I tried my best. Regardless of the result, I think this was a great opportunity.
