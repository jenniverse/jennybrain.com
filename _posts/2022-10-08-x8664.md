# x86 Control Flow

## Memory & Word Size
`B, W, L, Q`
- Big-Endian: MS byte is put at the starting address.
- Little-Endian: LS byte is put at the starting address.


- `$` indicates the constant.
- If hex without `$`, it's address

## `mov`
### Destination
- register
    - Only when destination is register and it's `movl`, the rest of bytes are cleared to zero.
- memory location
    - Can't move memory address to memory address
### Zero / Sign Extension
- Destination should be **register**
- `movzxy`: zero-extend
    - No `movzlq`!!!
- `movsxy`: sign-extend
    - `cltq` is equivalent to `movslq`

### Legal move combinations:
- `Imm -> Reg`
- `Imm -> Mem`
- `Reg -> Reg`
- `Reg -> Mem`
- `Mem -> Reg`


## *Whenever there's 4 bytes(`l`) operation, clear 4 bytes out!!!*

## Arithmetic Instructions

- Both operands cannot be memory

### `mul`
- Unsigned: `mul[l,q] src` 
- Signed: `imul[l,q] src` 
- Long: `%edx:%eax = %eax * src (mull)`
- Quad: `%rdx:%rax = %rax * src (mulq)`

### `div`
- Unsigned: `div[l,q] src` 
- Signed: `idiv[l,q] src` 
- Divisor: `src`, Quotient: `%eax (%rax)`, Remainder: `%edx (%rdx)`
- Long: `%eax = %edx:%eax / src (divl)`
        `%edx = %edx % src`
- Quad: `%rax = %rdx:%rax / src (divq)`
        `%rdx = %rdx:%rax % src`

## Translation to Assembly
### 4 steps to translate C to assembly
1. Setup a pointer in a register
2. Load data from memory to a register (mov)
3. Process data (add, sun, and, or, shift, etc.)
4. Store data back to memory (mov)

## Inputs & Output:
- `rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9`
- Additional: pass on stack
- Output: `rax`

## Condition Codes (Flags)

- `SF`: sign flag (copy MSB)
- `ZF`: zero flag
- `OF`: 2's complement overflow flag
- `CF`: Unsigned overflow
- When `test`, OF and CF always set to 0.
- `mov` and `lea` leave the condition codes unaffected.
- `and, or, xor` update only SF and ZF and *clear OF and CF to 0**
- `not` does not affect the condition codes

## Shifts and Condition Codes
### All shift instructions
- Set `SF` and `ZF`
- `CF`: last bit shifted out
- `OF`: undef for shifts of more than 1 bit
    - Left shift by 1-bit
        - `OF`: 1 if MSB changed
    - Right shift by 1-bit
        - Logical: `OF`: original MSB of the input value
        - Arithmetic: `OF` is always set to 0

## Conditional Jump Instructions

- `je` jumps if `ZF`
- `jge` jumps if `~(SF^OF)`
- `js` jumps if `SF`

- Conditional moves are more pipelining friendly

## System Stack
- Tip of stack is accessed and maintained using `%rsp` (stack pointer) register
- `%rsp` points at top occupied location of the stack
- `pushq %reg` is equivalent to
`subq $8, %rsp`
`movq %rax, (%rsp)`
- `popq %reg` is equivalent to
`movq (%rsp), %rdx`
`addq $8, %rsp`
- `pushw` and `popw` are also available.
- If address is saved in register -> can't use it

## Caller & Callee-Saved Convention
- Callee-saved: preserved
    - Callee must ensure the value is not modified
    - Push values before overwriting them
    - Restore before returning
    - `%rbp, %rbx, %r12-r15, %rsp*`
- Caller-saved: overwritten freely
    - Caller must save the value if it wants to preserve it across a function call
    - Push if the register value is needed after the function call
    - Callee can freely overwrite
    - Caller will restore upon return
    - `all other registers`
